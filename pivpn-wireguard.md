If your PiVPN WireGuard setup is connected but you're experiencing no traffic, there are several potential issues you could troubleshoot. Here are some steps to help you diagnose and resolve the problem:

Check Client Configuration:

Ensure the client configuration file is correctly set up with the right server address, public key, and allowed IPs.
Check WireGuard Status on the Server:

Run sudo wg on your server to verify the status of your WireGuard interface. Ensure the connection shows as established with the client.
Firewall and NAT Configuration:

Verify that your firewall allows WireGuard traffic. You can use iptables or ufw (depending on your setup) to check rules.
Make sure you have proper NAT (Network Address Translation) rules set up. This typically involves forwarding traffic from the WireGuard interface to your main network interface. Here’s an example for iptables:
bash
Copy code
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
Replace eth0 with your main network interface.
Server Network Configuration:

Ensure the server’s network settings are configured to allow traffic from the WireGuard network. Check your /etc/sysctl.conf file for the following line and ensure it is uncommented:
bash
Copy code
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
Apply the changes with sudo sysctl -p.
DNS Configuration:

Verify that your client has a DNS server configured, either through the client configuration file or manually on the client device. Make sure the DNS server is reachable through the VPN.
Route Table on the Client:

Check the client’s routing table to ensure that traffic is being routed through the WireGuard interface. On most systems, you can use the route or ip route commands to check the routing table.
Test Connectivity:

Use ping and traceroute from the client to test connectivity to both the WireGuard server and other internet addresses. This can help identify where the traffic is being blocked or misrouted.
Check Logs for Errors:

Review logs on both the client and server to identify any errors or issues. On the server, check system logs (usually in /var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages).
MTU Settings:

Incorrect MTU settings can cause connectivity issues. Try setting the MTU to a lower value (e.g., 1280) on both the client and server.
Client Software:

Ensure that the client software is up-to-date and correctly configured.
By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue causing no traffic despite the WireGuard VPN showing as connected. If the problem persists, consider sharing specific logs or error messages for further assistance.

From the output of the sudo wg command, it appears that your WireGuard interface wg0 is correctly configured and actively receiving and sending data. Here’s how to proceed to troubleshoot the lack of traffic beyond the VPN connection:

Steps to Diagnose and Fix Traffic Issues
Check IP Forwarding and NAT Configuration:

Ensure IP forwarding is enabled:

bash
Copy code
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
If it returns 0, enable it by running:

bash
Copy code
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
To make it permanent, add or uncomment the following line in /etc/sysctl.conf:

bash
Copy code
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
Verify that NAT is set up correctly using iptables:

bash
Copy code

*sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j*

MASQUERADE
Replace eth0 with the name of your external network interface. You can find this with ip addr.

Check Firewall Rules:

Ensure the firewall is not blocking WireGuard traffic:
bash
Copy code
sudo iptables -L
sudo iptables -L -t nat
Look for rules that may be dropping or blocking traffic to/from the WireGuard interface.
DNS Configuration:

Confirm that the client’s DNS settings are correct. If you’re using a DNS server through the VPN, ensure it is reachable and properly configured in the client config.
Client-Side Route Table:

On the client device, check that the default route is through the WireGuard interface. This can be done using:
bash
Copy code
ip route
The output should show a default route (0.0.0.0/0) via the WireGuard interface (wg0 or similar).
MTU Issues:

Incorrect MTU settings can lead to issues. On both the server and client, set the MTU to a lower value if necessary:
bash
Copy code
sudo ip link set dev wg0 mtu 1280
Replace wg0 with the correct interface name if different.
Check WireGuard Logs:

Check logs for any errors or warnings. On Linux, you can typically find these in /var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages.
Testing Connectivity:

From the client, try to ping the server’s VPN IP and vice versa:

bash
Copy code
ping 10.143.23.1
Replace 10.143.23.1 with the appropriate IP if different.

Use traceroute to see the path traffic takes. This can help identify where the traffic is getting lost.

Update WireGuard:

Ensure both the client and server have the latest version of WireGuard installed. Update packages using your distribution's package manager.
Client Configuration Review:

Double-check the client configuration to ensure the public and private keys are correctly set up, and the allowed IPs include all traffic (0.0.0.0/0 and ::/0).
If, after these steps, the issue persists, further troubleshooting may be required by sharing specific error messages or logs, which can offer additional insights.
